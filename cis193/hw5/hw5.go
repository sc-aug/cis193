// retry is the number of times that the task should be attempted. If a task
// returns an error, the function should be retried immediately up to `retry`
// times. Only send the results of a task into the output channel if it does not error.
//
// Multiple instances of ConcurrentRetry should be able to run simultaneously
// without interfering with one another, so global variables should not be used.
// The function must return the channel without waiting for the tasks to
// execute, and all results should be sent on the output channel. Once all tasks
// have been completed, close the channel.
